The deliverable is in the directory antlr4.
-------------------------------------------

The parser was implemented in python using the antlr4 parser generator.
My python script parser24.py uses the auto-generated parser files to parse a
quirk24 file, and then uses my visitor class quirk24Ast.py to generate the
AST, by visiting every node of the parser tree.


Dependencies
------------

- python 3
- antlr 4 (optional)
   * https://www.antlr.org/
   * In debian based systems use: "apt-get install antlr4"
- antlr4 python3 runtime
   * In debian based systems use:
      ** "apt-get install python3-pip"
      ** "pip3 install antlr4-python3-runtime"

If antlr4 is installed, the bash script build.sh, builds the
auto-generated parser files using the grammar I wrote in file quirk24.g4.
The auto-generated parser files are included so that installing antlr4 is not
required.


How to execute
--------------

cd antlr4

./parser24.py file.q24 file.ast

or

python3 parser24.py file.q24 file.ast



Submitted code that does not work
---------------------------------

The directory bison contains almost a complete parser for the AST written in
OCaml.
- To compile run bash script build.sh to generate the executable parser24.
- Run as ./parser24 file.q24. It prints an AST on stdout.
- Dependencies: OCaml (version 4+), ocamllex, ocamlyacc.
- Optional: menhir which is an alternative to ocamlyacc (see inside build.sh)

Parser.conflicts contains the information on the 2 shift/reduce conflicts.
This file is generated using menhir (menhir -v Parser.mly) and is more
informative than Parser.output which is generated by ocamlyacc
(ocamlyacc -v Parser.mly).

The file Lexer.mll contains the lexer rules, the file Parser.mly contains the
parsing rules, the file Ast.ml contains the AST type essentially, the file
Astprint.ml prints the AST and the file Main.ml runs everything together.

The directory bison contains the lexer and parser written in C++ (but
essentially C). I am using g++ to compile, because I would use the data
structures in the C++ std library.

- To compile run make, to generate the executable parser24.
- Dependencies: gcc, flex, bison.
- Run as ./parser24 file.q24.
